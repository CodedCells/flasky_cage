write a web server in python 3, make it read a ist of posts from a sqlite3 table.
each post has a unique numerical ID, title, filename, uploader, tags (comma seperated string), and other contributing uploaders (also comma seperated string).

please make it include the following pages:
list of uploaders, sort it by the count of posts they've made, and show the most recent one as a thumbnail.
a page for each uploader showing only their posts,
another page for each uploader showing posts they've contributed to.
a page for a specific post only.
a page for each tag showing only posts with that tag,
and a way to search for uploaders and tags to find matching results
